This site is built to review database functions using MySQL and Entity Core Framework in Epicodus' C# and .NET course. It allows a user to make entries for stylists and clients associated with those stylists, then view that data at their leisure.

## Setup

1. Clone this repository from GitHub.
2. Open the downloaded directory in a text editor of your choice. (VSCode, Atom, etc.)
3. To install the REPL dotnet script, run dotnet tool install -g dotnet-script in your terminal.
4. If you do not have MySQL Community Server installed, go to https://www.learnhowtoprogram.com/c-and-net/getting-started-with-c/installing-and-configuring-mysql and follow along with the instructions for your operating system.
5. In your terminal, start MySQL by typing "mysql -uroot -pYourPasswordHere", then cut and paste the commands found in ethan_firpo.sql in the root directory of this project.
5. Navigate to the directory HairSalon/ and run the program with the commands dotnet restore, dotnet build, and dotnet run.
